# 0-1-knapsack-problem

We are given n items with some weights and corresponding values and a knapsack of capacity W. The items should be placed in the knapsack in such a way that the total value is maximum and total weight should be less than knapsack capacity.

In this problem 0-1 means that we canâ€™t put the items in fraction. Either put the complete item or ignore it. Below is the solution for this problem in C using dynamic programming
